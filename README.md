# Greenlight

Greenlight is a minimal web RESTful application built to practice backend development, system architecture, and deployment workflow. While the business logic is simple, the project focuses on clean code structure, Docker-based environment management, and production-ready deployment practices.

## Stack and Tools

- **Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Routing**: [`httprouter`](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Environment Configuration**: `.env`, `envconfig`
- **Deployment**: EC2 (Ubuntu), managed via systemd and Makefile
- **Build Tools**: Makefile, Bash scripts
- **Observability**: Structured logging, trace ID injection

## Features

- Modular project structure (`cmd`, `internal`, `migrations`)
- Graceful shutdown, timeouts, and context propagation
- Channel-based background workers
- Docker-based local development with isolated DB
- Production-ready configuration with `.env` and secrets management
- Zero-downtime deploys via `make reload`

## Architecture Overview

This is the production and staging architecture used to deploy Greenlight. The infrastructure includes a reverse proxy, separated environments, and cloud services for storage, email, and monitoring.
